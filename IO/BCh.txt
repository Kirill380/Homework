Dear Dr. Tracy,

I am a 33 year old divorced woman with four kids. I was married for 12 years and I have been divorced for
approximately 3 years. I met my new boyfriend during my divorce. We hit it off and have been together ever
since. He is a 44 year old divorced man. When I met him he had been divorced for 2 years. Well, I met his exwife
and she seemed to be an okay person. What I found out 3 months into my relationship with him was that
he was fooling around with his ex-wife again-- who also at this time had a boyfriend of her own. I figured
that since I did not have a committed relationship with him, I had no place to say anything. The problem is
it continued further into our relationship, up to the point when I found out I was pregnant. At the same time I
found out that he and his ex-wife planned to go to his family reunion together. Of course before all of this, I
drove by his house one night and saw her car parked outside his home. The excuse I got after all of this was
that they were considering getting back together. I thought it was very funny that as soon as she met me, she
found interest in him again.
